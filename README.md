# GuessifyGame

### By Omar, Bashar, Momen (2024)

**Guessify**  
An educational game about Palestinian heritage, culture, and history. The game is a multiplayer experience where you can create a room or join an existing room. Once at least two players join, the game will start automatically after 30 seconds.

This is where the AI integration plays a crucial role: we used OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate questions for each round. These questions focus on Palestinian history, heritage, or culture, varying in pattern every time.

Each round lasts **60 seconds** and offers **6 multiple-choice options**. Players earn points based on the time taken to answer and the correctness of their answers. A **hint system** allows players to use one of their points to receive a clue from ChatGPT about the question.

After 5 rounds, the game concludes by declaring the winner.

**We used AWS EC2 and other tools to host the game online, making it accessible to everyone. This game was developed as part of a paid backend internship at Co.Te.De Technology.**

## **Purpose of the Project**

The primary focus of this project was to integrate **WebSocket** for real-time communication and the **OpenAI API** for generating questions dynamically.

⚠️ **Note**:  
This internship focused solely on backend development, not frontend. We used basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to visualize the game, but we are not specialized in frontend development. Expect a functional, but not highly polished, interface.
